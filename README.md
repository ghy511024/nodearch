## üëã Welcome to NodeArch

NodeArch is a backend framework for Node.js that aims to address design and architectural issues when building Node.js applications. It uses Typescript and dependency injection to bring concepts from languages like Java and C# to Node.js, while still taking advantage of Javascript's flexibility and Node.js's non-blocking I/O model. NodeArch is designed to work seamlessly with existing tools and libraries, rather than replacing them, and focuses on creating a readable, maintainable, and scalable application architecture. It acts as a glue that connects all your tools and libraries together, making it easier to develop and maintain your Node.js applications.
